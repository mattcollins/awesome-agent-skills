# 🎯 Awesome Agent Skills [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> 🚀 Your ultimate guide to **Agent Skills** - the open format that supercharges AI agents with specialized knowledge and workflows!

## 💡 What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are like superpowers for your AI agents! Each skill is a simple folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions and optional scripts/resources. The magic? Agents discover and load these capabilities **on-demand** through "progressive disclosure" - meaning they only load what they need, when they need it.

**Think of it as**: Installing apps on your phone, but for AI agents! 📱

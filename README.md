# Awesome Agent Skills [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of useful resources for **Agent Skills** - a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

## 🌟 What are Agent Skills?

A **Skill** is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file (with metadata and instructions) and optional scripts/resources. This format allows agents to discover and load capabilities on demand, a concept known as **"progressive disclosure"**.

Think of skills as "plugins" or "knowledge packs" that your agent can read to learn how to perform specific tasks—like editing a PDF, analyzing data, or managing a project—without needing that knowledge hardcoded into its system prompt.
